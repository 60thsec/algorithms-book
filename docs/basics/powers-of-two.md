# Powers of two

You need to know the powers of two like the back of your hand. 

The most imporant one that people test on are `2^10`. Its generally safe to assume `1000` (instead of exact `1024`). 


* You will be asked to use it for stuff like `log2 (n)`. A thousand is `10` a million is `20` a billion is `30`
* You will use it to get KB (`/1000`) MB (`/1000000`) etc.

> Note KB/MB/GB/TB are used for *bytes*. Its best to stick with this for napkin discussions.
