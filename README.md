I feel that being a successful software developer requires a solid knowledge of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms. However it is also important to be familiar with your tools of trade (your programming language / environment). This is the book that a CS student can use to refresh their knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms or just review how to do them in TypeScript.

The code in this book should also provide idiomatic TypeScript code samples. Should should be able to see the advantages that having a Type system can bring to documenting your code.
