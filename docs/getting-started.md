# Getting Started

## Code
You need NodeJS. Go ahead and install the latest version you can find.

All code is writen in TypeScript *nightly*. After all, the compiler test suite is more reliable than our code bases ðŸŒ¹

```
npm install typescript@next
```

Run the compiler

```
tsc -w
```

Run any file you want now:
```
node someCode.ts
```

## Sections
I recommend going through the book page by page. Or jump straight to the section you want. If you feel you aren't getting it...go a step back.
